# Performance model

dotdart moves asset parsing and most metadata work to generation time so the
application does less work while rendering.

## SVG and Lottie

- Source XML and JSON are not parsed at runtime.
- Geometry is emitted as reusable Dart `Path` data.
- Generated painters reuse paints and static geometry where possible.
- Lottie text painters retain their layout between frames, and adjacent
  constant keyframes are compacted before source is emitted.
- Sequential trim-path lengths are computed once instead of being added again
  for every animated frame.
- Generated output imports Flutter SDK libraries but no SVG, Lottie, or dotdart
  runtime package.
- Explicitly sized widgets remain finite inside unbounded parents such as
  `Column`.

## Images and GIFs

- Intrinsic dimensions and dominant color are computed during generation.
- Decode cache dimensions follow the requested display size.
- Thumbhash placeholder colors are decoded during generation and embedded as
  constants, so the first frame does not parse base64 or run inverse-DCT math.
- Per-asset cache methods can warm only the images needed for the next screen.
- Matching removal methods release decoded entries after they are no longer
  needed, instead of retaining full-screen image memory indefinitely.
- Removal preserves live image entries, avoiding a duplicate decode when the
  same image is still displayed during a transition.
- Generated images use repaint boundaries to isolate expensive repaints.

Generated image and GIF accessors and their cache methods accept an optional
`imageCache`. Supply the same Flutter `ImageCache` instance when warming,
rendering, and removing an asset to keep its decoded images separate from the
application's shared cache. Your cache owner must set its memory budget and
clear it when the application receives memory pressure. Omitting `imageCache`
keeps Flutter's shared-cache behavior.

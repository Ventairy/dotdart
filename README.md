Type-safe Flutter asset access, generated as optimized Dart code.

dotdart compiles supported SVG, Lottie, images, and GIFs into strongly named
Flutter widgets such as `$Icons.cross()`, `$Lotties.pulse()`, and
`$Images.cataqui()`. Asset mistakes fail during generation instead of becoming
runtime surprises.

## Lottie performance

For the 978 KB job-card carousel in this repository's example, the generated
widget sustained 60.2 FPS while the
[`lottie` 3.5.1](https://pub.dev/packages/lottie/versions/3.5.1) player sustained
27.2 FPS:

| Renderer       | Frames in 10 seconds | Average UI time | Average raster time | Missed UI frames |
| -------------- | -------------------: | --------------: | ------------------: | ---------------: |
| dotdart output |                  602 |        0.434 ms |             4.62 ms |            0/602 |
| `lottie` 3.5.1 |                  272 |        32.04 ms |             3.33 ms |          271/272 |

That is about 74 times less UI-thread work and 7 times less combined UI and
raster time for this animation. The comparison used the same canvas and asset
for two 10-second profile-mode runs on the same macOS host. It demonstrates the
relative rendering cost of these implementations, not guaranteed frame rates on
every device; profile representative animations on target hardware before
shipping performance-critical experiences.

## Platform support

Generated widgets support Flutter on Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows, and
Linux, including Web's JavaScript and Wasm compilation targets.

dotdart itself runs on the development machine through `build_runner`. Keep it
in `dev_dependencies`; applications import the generated libraries rather than
dotdart at runtime.

## Why dotdart?

- **Typed access:** rename or remove an asset and Dart analysis finds every stale
  call site.
- **No SVG or Lottie runtime renderer:** supported vectors and animations become
  ordinary `CustomPainter` code.
- **Low-resource image defaults:** generated image and GIF widgets include
  decode sizing, intrinsic metadata, a build-time-decoded thumbhash placeholder,
  and per-asset cache controls.
- **Build-time validation:** malformed configuration, unsupported content,
  duplicate inputs, naming collisions, and unsafe output paths fail early.
- **Self-contained output:** generated libraries depend on Flutter, not dotdart.

## Install

Add dotdart and build_runner as development dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub add --dev dotdart build_runner
```

## Quick start

Configure the inputs and output in your package's `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dotdart:
  output: lib/gen/
  svg:
    - assets/icons/
  lottie:
    - assets/lotties/
  image:
    - assets/images/

flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

Images and GIFs remain Flutter assets because their generated widgets use
`Image.asset`. SVG and Lottie inputs are compiled into Dart and do not need to
be listed under `flutter.assets`.

Generate the libraries:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

Import and use the namespace generated from each source folder:

```dart
import 'package:my_app/gen/icons.g.dart';
import 'package:my_app/gen/images.g.dart';
import 'package:my_app/gen/lotties.g.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

final closeIcon = $Icons.close(width: 24);
final nestedGroups = $Icons.nestedGroups(
  width: 80,
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  outlineColor: Colors.black,
  innerTextColor: Colors.white,
);
final pulse = $Lotties.pulse(
  width: 96,
  delay: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
  playback: LottiePlayback.loop,
);
final jobCards = $Lotties.jobCards(
  width: 320,
  clip: false,
  overrides: const JobCardsOverrides(
    jobTitleText: 'Event server',
    payTextColor: Colors.green,
  ),
);
final image = $Images.profile(width: 160);

await $ImagesCache.precacheProfile(context, width: 160);
// Render $Images.profile(width: 160), then release that decoded entry later.
final removed = await $ImagesCache.removeProfile(context, width: 160);
```

Cache dimensions are logical pixels. Use the same width and height when
precaching, rendering, and removing an image or GIF. When both dimensions are
omitted, the cache methods use the generated widget's default display size.
Removal preserves an image that is still being displayed while releasing its
reusable cache entry.

When using generated images or GIFs from another package, pass that package's
name to rendering and cache calls:

```dart
await $ImagesCache.precacheProfile(context, width: 160, package: 'my_assets');
final image = $Images.profile(width: 160, package: 'my_assets');
final removed = await $ImagesCache.removeProfile(context, width: 160, package: 'my_assets');
```

The package must declare the images or GIFs under `flutter: assets:`. Omit
`package` for assets generated in the app itself.

Look up an asset using its original filename when the name is known at runtime:

```dart
final icon = $Icons.findByName('close.svg', width: 24) ??
    const SizedBox.shrink();
```

`findByName` matches the exact filename, including its extension and case,
within that namespace. Unknown names and directory paths return `null`.
It accepts `key`, `width`, and `height`, preserving the selected asset's
existing sizing rules and defaults. Use the named accessor for asset-specific
options such as colors, animation progress, or image fitting.
For image and GIF namespaces, `findByName` also accepts `package`.

Supported Lottie text and colors become fields on the generated `overrides`
object.
Repeated names receive numbered suffixes, such as `jobTitleText2`, so each layer
remains independent. Unnamed layers use predictable `text1`, `color1`, and later
fallbacks.

Generated Lotties clip painting to their source canvas by default. Pass
`clip: false` when artwork should remain visible outside that boundary.

Use `delay` to wait once before automatic playback starts. Use `duration` to
override the total playback time and make the animation faster or slower while
preserving the relative timing of its keyframes. When `duration` is omitted,
the animation uses the duration stored in the Lottie file.

Generated Lotties play once by default and keep their final frame visible. Pass
`playback: LottiePlayback.loop` to repeat an animation continuously. The
generated namespace library re-exports `LottiePlayback`, so no additional
import is needed.

Supported trim paths preserve animated start, end, and offset values in the
default drawing direction, including parallel and sequential handling when one
shape group contains multiple paths.

SVG transforms include `translate()`, `scale()`, `rotate()`, `matrix()`,
`skewX()`, and `skewY()` on groups, drawable shapes, and shapes inside clip
paths. Matrix and skew calculations happen at build time, and generated
painters reuse cached matrix data.

Supported SVG colors remain direct optional parameters on their generated
accessors. A drawable `id` names its colors; otherwise dotdart uses the nearest
ancestor group `id`. For example, `id="outline"` produces `outlineColor`.
Multiple colors in that scope become `outlineColor1`, `outlineColor2`, and so
on in fill-before-stroke source order. Equal colors under different IDs stay
independently customizable. Anonymous colors use `color1`, `color2`, and later
fallbacks.

## Generated output

| Input                        | Generated API          | Runtime implementation          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `assets/icons/close.svg`     | `$Icons.close(...)`    | Dependency-free `CustomPainter` |
| `assets/lotties/pulse.json`  | `$Lotties.pulse(...)`  | Lifecycle-aware `CustomPainter` |
| `assets/images/profile.webp` | `$Images.profile(...)` | Optimized `Image.asset`         |

Namespaces containing images or GIFs also generate a companion cache class,
such as `$ImagesCache`. Mixed folders generate cache methods only for their
image and GIF assets.

Assets are grouped by their parent folder. Mixed asset types in
`assets/status/` share one `lib/gen/status.g.dart` library and one
`$Status` namespace.

Generated widget classes are private. Consume assets through their public
namespace methods and do not edit generated files by hand.

When the package contains Lottie inputs, dotdart also writes `dotdart.g.dart`
beside the namespace libraries for shared generated types such as
`LottiePlayback`.
